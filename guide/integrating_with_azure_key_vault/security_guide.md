## Overview
Azure Key Vault is a secure cloud service that provides a safe way to store and access secrets, keys, and certificates. By integrating Key Vault, developers can eliminate the need to hardcode secrets, reducing security risks and simplifying secret management across environments.

## Best Practices
### 1. Setup and Access Control
**Use Managed Identities**: For applications in Azure, enable Managed Identity to access Key Vault without requiring credentials.
**Limit Access**: Only allow necessary services and users access to secrets, keys, and certificates.
**Network Security**: Use virtual network service endpoints or private endpoints for secure access to Key Vault from within your network.

### 2. Secure Authentication and Access Policies
**Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign Key Vault access through RBAC at the Azure level, which is more manageable than using access policies directly in Key Vault.
**Restrict Access by Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions required (e.g., get and list for read access) and avoid using high-level permissions such as All.
**Enable Managed Identities for Workloads**: Managed identities allow workloads to access Azure Key Vault securely without hardcoded credentials.

### 3. Application Integration
**Use the Azure SDK**: Leverage the Azure SDK to fetch secrets at runtime. Avoid storing or hardcoding secrets in code.
**Set Up Caching for Secrets**: To avoid excessive Key Vault requests, cache secrets within the application securely, ensuring they are updated only when needed.
**Handle Secrets with Security in Mind**: Ensure secrets are decrypted and managed in memory only for as long as needed, avoiding unnecessary logging or persistence.

### 4. Terraform Integration
**Use Terraform Providers**: Utilize the Azure Provider for Terraform, with Key Vault data sources to retrieve secrets without hardcoding.
**Reference Key Vault Secrets Securely**: Use `data "azurerm_key_vault_secret"` to fetch secrets securely, ensuring sensitive data isn't stored in Terraform state files.
**Configure State File Security**: Use remote storage with access controls and encryption for Terraform state files to prevent secret leakage.

### 5. Jenkins Pipeline Integration
**Use Azure Key Vault Plugin**: Install and configure the Azure Key Vault plugin for Jenkins to securely retrieve secrets within pipelines.
**Avoid Hardcoded Secrets in Scripts**: Pull secrets dynamically using environment variables set by the plugin or `azure-keyvault` CLI commands in scripts.
**Secure Jenkins Credentials**: Use Jenkins credentials to store and manage sensitive information and avoid storing them in scripts or configurations.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
**Enable Diagnostic Logging**: Enable and review Key Vault’s diagnostic logs to track access and detect unauthorized access attempts.
**Set up Alerts for Unauthorized Access**: Configure alerts for unusual access patterns or denied access events to respond quickly to security incidents.

### 7. Secret Rotation
**Automate Secret Rotation**: Use Key Vault’s integration with Azure Key Rotation for automatic key rotation and secure renewal of secrets.
**Notify or Update Applications on Secret Changes**: Implement application logic to handle secret rotation, ensuring seamless access after rotation by refreshing secrets from Key Vault.

## Checklist
### Setup and Access Control
- [ ] **Managed Identity Enabled**: Ensure Managed Identity is enabled for Azure services to access Key Vault.
- [ ] **Access Restricted by RBAC**: Grant access based on roles with the least privilege.
- [ ] **Private Endpoint Configured (if needed)**: Use a virtual or private endpoint for Key Vault to restrict public network access.

### Authentication and Access Policies
- [ ] **Managed Identity for Application Access**: Ensure applications access Key Vault using Managed Identity without credentials.
- [ ] **Minimal Permissions Granted**: Ensure permissions are limited to `get` and `list` for read access as necessary.

### Application Integration
- [ ] **Azure SDK Used**: 	Ensure secrets are fetched using Azure SDK at runtime instead of hardcoded.
- [ ] **Secrets Cached Securely**: Implement caching to reduce frequent Key Vault calls while securely storing secrets temporarily.
- [ ] **Secrets Not Persisted**: Avoid logging or persisting secrets on local storage or unprotected memory.

### Terraform Integration
- [ ] **Key Vault Data Source Used**: Use data `"azurerm_key_vault_secret"` to fetch secrets securely within Terraform.
- [ ] **State Files Secured**: Ensure state files are encrypted and stored in a secure remote backend.

### Jenkins Pipeline Integration
- [ ] **Azure Key Vault Plugin Installed**: Ensure the Azure Key Vault plugin is configured in Jenkins to fetch secrets securely.
- [ ] **Avoided Hardcoding in Scripts**: Use environment variables or the Azure CLI to dynamically pull secrets within Jenkins scripts.

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] **Diagnostic Logging Enabled**: Ensure Key Vault diagnostic logging is enabled to monitor access activity.
- [ ] **Alerts Configured**: Set up alerts for unauthorized or unusual access patterns.

### Secret Rotation
- [ ] **Automatic Rotation Enabled**: Enable Azure Key Vault’s rotation policies for automated secret/key rotation.
- [ ] **Application Handles Rotation Gracefully**: Ensure applications can handle secret rotation by re-fetching secrets from Key Vault if needed.
